# dr-quine
Quines in C and ASM. A quine is defined as a program that produces its own source code as output.

This project consists of the following exercises:
  - Colleen: Create a quine consisting of 2 functions and 2 comments.
  - Grace: Create a quine with only 3 defines and no main function.
  - Sully: Create a quine which reproduces itself by writing its source to disk, compiles and then executes it.
